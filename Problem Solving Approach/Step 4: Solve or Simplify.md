# Simplify

- Find the core difficulty in what you’re trying to do
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Then incorporate that difficulty back in

# Example

Write a function that takes in a string and returns counts of each character

### Possible Difficulties

- Looping if you don’t know loop well → hardcoding
- Keys and values → tricky if you don't know the object
- Uppercase methods → ignore, google it, solve it
