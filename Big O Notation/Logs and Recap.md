# Logarithms

- Sometimes big O expressions involve more complex mathematical expressions
- Logarithm is one of them that appears often
- The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get a value that less than or equal to one

# Where to Face Logarithm?

- Certain searching algorithms have logarithmic time complexity
- Efficient sorting algorithms involve logarithms.
- Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity

# Recap

- To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation
- Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm
- Big O Notation doesnâ€™t care about precision but about general trends.
- The time or space complexity depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm
- Big O Notation is everywhere, so get lots of practice
