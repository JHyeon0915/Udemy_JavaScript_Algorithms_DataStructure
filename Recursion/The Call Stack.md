# Call Stack

- Itâ€™s a stack data structure
- Any time a function is invoked, it is pushed on the top of the call stack
- When JavaScript sees the return keyword or when the function ends, the compiler will pop it

# Why Do I Care?

- When we write recursive functions, we keep pushing new functions onto the call stack
